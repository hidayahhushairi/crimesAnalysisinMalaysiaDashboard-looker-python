## Introduction
Crimes are defined as acts carried out by individuals or groups of individuals with malicious intent that result in harm, property loss, or fatalities. The components of the crime index are the result of social welfare, law enforcement, and economic stability. This dashboard was created with the intention of raising public awareness of Malaysia's crime index, which has increased tremendously among society, and enhancing strategies for policymakers.

## Methodology
- Data Source : The Department of Statistics Malaysia's OpenDOSM open data source platform contributed the dataset used in this study. The Royal Malaysian Police's (RMP) administrative records serve as its foundation. The crimes listed are real offenses for which a conviction has actually been obtained. Disaggregated analyses on crime rates have been marginalized comprehensively by state, district, and type and category - property and violent crimes.

- Technology : Looker Studio, Python, Google Sheet 

- Technique : Descriptive and Predictive Analysis

- Figure 1 : Summary of Crime Cases in Malaysia - Pivot Table Data Bars

 <br> Data bars are set to illustrate the amount of crimes for the category of property and assault crimes from 2016 until 2023.

  It can be seen that the number of property crimes over 9 years for 12 types of crimes. Property crimes are vehicle theft and break-in, while assault crimes are robbery, causing injury, rape, and murder.

  Overall, in both categories, the number of property crimes committed by offenders is the highest, at 1.4M of total crime cases, compared to assault crimes at 367k in total.

  The highest property crime is the theft vehicle motorcycle cases, 487k in total, while robbery gang unarmed reached 133k cases.

  

- Figure 2 : District of Crime Cases in Malaysia - Bubble Mapped Chart

  <br> Depicted the magnitude in the specific states and crimes in a particular district. Big bubbles in the chart represent a larger number of crime cases.

   In contrast, from the chart, we can see the differences between the total number of crime cases that occurred in 14 districts within Malaysia.

  Central to this study delineating high-risk areas are Petaling Jaya, followed by Gombak and Dang Wangi, with 46k, 39k, and 38k cases.

 <br> By identifying specific areas where crimes are prevalent, this study aims to contribute to the development of tailored crime prevention strategies and foster safer neighbourhoods.

  Professional parties should unite in identifying crime incidents, such as the Anti-Drug Agency (AADK), Islamic Religious Office, District Office, and NGOs.

<br> Concurrently, communities and parents must take precautions in monitoring outdoor activities among their contacts and family, especially in residential areas and transport infrastructures.

  <br> Presented a visually appealing view of the crime amounts by states.

  Selangor, Wilayah Persekutuan Kuala Lumpur, Johor, Kedah, and Sarawak are listed as the top 5 states ranking the highest in crimes, with 26.03% (630k), 12.83% (310k), 10.89% (263k), 7.13% (172k), and 7.12% (172k) cases accordingly. These states require specific attention, due to their evolving economy opportunities and exposure to intemperate illegal immigrants.

## Conclusion
Every day there are tragic events that serve to remind us that life is fragile and precarious. This study implies a dashboard visually displays the geographical and the classification of crimes index data. It is to enhance policymakers ability to identify repeat victimization and a miscellaneous group among offenders in the hot spot and assigned areas. By monitoring the forecast of the crime index, RMP has been revealed to the trend line, establishing the requirement to renew strategies in imposing appropriate punishment and obtain more investigation information effectively. Ultimately, the RMP team also must obey integrity. Incidents of corruption and abuse of power involving RMP members can affect their responsibilities to reduce the major crimes index as well as promote a safe and secure society.
